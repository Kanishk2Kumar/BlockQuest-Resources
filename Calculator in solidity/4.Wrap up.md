# Wrap Up

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰  

In this course, we:
- Learned the fundamentals of Solidity.
- Built a **calculator smart contract** with essential arithmetic functions.
- Deployed and tested the contract successfully.

## Next Steps:
- Add a **modulus function** to the calculator.
- Experiment with gas optimization techniques.
- Explore Solidity events and modifiers for improved functionality.

Keep practicing and building! ðŸš€
