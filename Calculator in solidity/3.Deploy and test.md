## Step 3: Deploy and Test the Contract  

After writing and compiling your Solidity contract, follow these steps to deploy and test it in Remix IDE:  

1. **Deploy the Contract**  
   - Click on the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab (Ethereum icon).  
   - Ensure **Environment** is set to "Remix VM (London)" for testing.  
   - Click **Deploy**, and Remix will generate an instance of the contract.  

2. **Expand the Contract Instance**  
   - Scroll down to find the deployed contract under **Deployed Contracts**.  
   - Click on the contract name to expand and view available functions.  

3. **Test the Calculator Functions**  
   - Enter two numbers in the input fields next to functions like `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.  
   - Click the function button to execute the operation.  
   - Check the output to verify the correctness of each operation.  

4. **Ensure All Operations Work Correctly**  
   - Try different numbers, including edge cases like `0` for division.  
   - If any errors occur, review the contract and fix them in Remix.  

Once tested successfully, your **Solidity Calculator** is ready for use! âœ…
